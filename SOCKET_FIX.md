# ðŸ”§ Socket.io Infinite Loop - FIXED

## Problem
Socket.io was connecting and disconnecting infinitely, causing:
- Browser to hang
- Console spam with connect/disconnect messages
- CSP (Content Security Policy) errors

## Root Cause
The `useSocket` hook had `onEvents` as a dependency in the `connectSocket` callback, causing the socket to recreate on every render, leading to an infinite reconnection loop.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed useSocket Hook
**File**: `client/src/hooks/useSocket.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed `onEvents` from dependencies
- Used `useRef` to store events without triggering re-renders
- Changed to empty dependency array `[]` so socket only creates once
- Reduced reconnection attempts from 5 to 3
- Increased reconnection delay to prevent rapid reconnections
- Added both 'websocket' and 'polling' transports for better compatibility

### 2. Removed CSP Headers
**File**: `client/vite.config.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed Content-Security-Policy headers that were blocking eval
- Vite dev server doesn't need CSP in development

## Result
âœ… Socket connects once and stays connected
âœ… No more infinite loop
âœ… No more CSP errors
âœ… Console is clean

## How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R)
2. Open browser console
3. You should see:
   ```
   ðŸ”— Socket connected
   ```
4. **No repeated** connect/disconnect messages
5. Socket should stay connected

## What You'll See Now

### Before (BAD):
```
ðŸ”— Socket connected successfully
ðŸ”Œ Socket disconnected: io client disconnect
ðŸ”— Socket connected successfully
ðŸ”Œ Socket disconnected: io client disconnect
... (repeats infinitely)
```

### After (GOOD):
```
ðŸ”— Socket connected
```
That's it! Just one connection message.

## Additional Notes

- Socket will automatically reconnect if server restarts (up to 3 attempts)
- Reconnection delay is 2 seconds (prevents rapid reconnections)
- Both WebSocket and polling transports are supported for better compatibility
- Socket properly disconnects when component unmounts
