## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Creating Future Schedules:**

#### **Method 1: Admin Panel (Recommended)**

2. **Select future date** in the "Schedule Date" field
3. Fill in: Start Time, End Time, Room, Subject, Faculty
4. Click **"Add Schedule"**
5. ✅ **Schedule appears in calendar immediately**

#### **Method 2: Calendar Interface**

   - 📚 **Green cards** = Schedules (read-only)

## 📊 Enhanced Statistics

The calendar now shows **4 statistics cards**:

2. **📚 Schedules** - Total class/meeting schedules  
3. **This Month** - Combined count for current month
4. **Active Rooms** - Available rooms for booking

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**

#### **1. Admin Panel** (`client/src/pages/Admin.jsx`)
```javascript
// Added date picker to schedule form
<input
  type="date"
  value={form.scheduleDate || date}
  min={format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')}
  // ... allows future scheduling
/>

// Updated submission logic
const scheduleDate = form.scheduleDate || date;
await axiosAuth.post('/api/schedule', { ...form, date: scheduleDate });
```

#### **2. Calendar Component** (`client/src/components/Calendar.jsx`)
```javascript
// Added schedule loading
const loadSchedules = async () => {
  const response = await apiService.schedule.getAll();
  setSchedules(response.data || []);
};

// Unified day view
const getBookingsForDay = (day) => {
  const dayBookings = filteredBookings.filter(/*...*/);
  const daySchedules = filteredSchedules.filter(/*...*/).map(schedule => ({
    ...schedule,
    title: schedule.subject,
    room: schedule.room_number,
    type: 'schedule' // Identifies as schedule
  }));
  return [...dayBookings, ...daySchedules];
};
```

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Admin creates schedule** → Stored in `schedules` Map
2. **Calendar loads schedules** → Via `/api/schedule` endpoint  
3. **Calendar merges data** → Bookings + Schedules in unified view
4. **Color coding applied** → Blue for bookings, Green for schedules

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Schedule Cards (Green):**
- 📚 Icon prefix
- Green color scheme
- Shows: Subject, Time, Room, Faculty
- Read-only (no edit/delete buttons)

### **Booking Cards (Blue):**
- 🏢 Icon prefix  
- Blue color scheme
- Shows: Title, Time, Room, Organizer
- Editable (edit/delete buttons on hover)
