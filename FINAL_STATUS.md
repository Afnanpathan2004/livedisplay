# ✅ LiveBoard - Final Status Report

## 🎉 All Issues Resolved!

### Issues Fixed in This Session

#### 1. ✅ Display Page 401 Errors - FIXED
**Problem**: Display page was getting 401 Unauthorized errors
**Solution**: Made `/api/schedule` and `/api/announcements` endpoints PUBLIC (no authentication required)
**File**: `server/src/bulletproof-server.js`

#### 2. ✅ Infinite Redirect Loop - FIXED
**Problem**: "Maximum update depth exceeded" error causing browser to hang
**Solution**: Removed duplicate route definition for `path="/"` in App.jsx
**File**: `client/src/App.jsx` (lines 53-57 removed)

#### 3. ✅ ScheduleGrid Component Error - FIXED
**Problem**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')`
**Solution**: 
- Added null checks for time values
- Made component handle both ISO date strings and time strings
- Added fallback for empty data
- Changed grouping from `room_number` to `type` (matches server data structure)
**File**: `client/src/components/ScheduleGrid.jsx`

#### 4. ✅ React Router v7 Warnings - FIXED
**Problem**: Deprecation warnings about future React Router changes
**Solution**: Added future flags to BrowserRouter
**File**: `client/src/main.jsx`

#### 5. ✅ Missing AuthContext - FIXED
**Problem**: AuthContext.jsx was empty (0 bytes)
**Solution**: Created complete authentication context with login/register/logout
**File**: `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

#### 6. ✅ Server Endpoints - FIXED
**Problem**: Register endpoint didn't return token, /api/auth/me had wrong format
**Solution**: 
- Register now returns token for auto-login
- /api/auth/me returns `{ user: {...} }` format
- Added logout and refresh endpoints
- Added dashboard/stats endpoint
**File**: `server/src/bulletproof-server.js`
