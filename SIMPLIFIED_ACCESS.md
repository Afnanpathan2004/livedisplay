# Simplified Access Control

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Role-Based Restrictions**
- All logged-in users can now access all features
- No more admin/hr/manager/editor/viewer roles blocking access
- Simplified navigation menu

### 2. **Removed Demo Credentials from Login Page**
- Removed "Demo Credentials: admin / admin123" text
- Login page is now clean and production-ready

### 3. **Simplified Navigation Menu**
Now shows only 4 main items:
- **Dashboard** - LiveBoard display
- **Admin Panel** - Manage schedules and content
- **User Management** - Manage users and access
- **Settings** - Manage dropdown options

### 4. **User Management Access**
- Available to ANY logged-in user
- No admin role required
- First user to log in can manage all other users

## Default Login Credentials

**For Developer/First User:**
```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Change this password after first login!

## How It Works Now

1. **First Login**: Use admin/admin123
2. **Access User Management**: Click "User Management" in sidebar
3. **Add New Users**: 
   - Click "Add User"
   - Enter their details
   - They can log in immediately
4. **Manage Users**:
   - Edit user details
   - Activate/Deactivate accounts
   - Delete users
   - All without role restrictions

## Security Note

Since all logged-in users have full access:
- Only give login credentials to trusted users
- Regularly review the user list
- Remove users who no longer need access
- Consider changing the default admin password immediately

## For Production Deployment

1. Change default admin password
2. Create user accounts for your team
3. Remove or deactivate the default admin account after creating your own
4. Keep the user list updated
